## 2026-02-18 — Fix GPU startup race condition and socket path inconsistency

**Summary:** gRASPA failed to connect to the MACE server with "Connection refused"
when running on GPU. Three bugs combined to cause this.

### Changes

1. **`ase_ipi_server_mace.py`** — Moved socket `bind()`+`listen()` to before
   `get_calculator()`. Previously the model was loaded first, then the socket was
   created — on GPU this means `torch.load()` holds up socket creation for 30+
   seconds while gRASPA is already trying to connect. The OS now queues gRASPA's
   connection in the listen backlog while the model loads.

2. **`gcmc_mace.bash`** — Replaced `sleep 1` with a poll loop that waits up to
   300 seconds for the socket file to appear (`[ -S "${SOCKET_PATH}" ]`), so
   gRASPA is never launched until the server is provably ready regardless of model
   load time.

3. **`gcmc_mace.bash`** — Fixed stale `ipi_` prefix in socket path. The old
   script cleaned up and polled `/tmp/ipi_ase_ipi_socket` while the Python server
   and C++ client both use `/tmp/ase_ipi_socket`. Introduced `SOCKET_PATH`
   variable derived consistently from `SOCKET_NAME`. Also corrected `--device`
   flag from `cpu` to `cuda` for GPU runs.

## 2026-02-17 — Fix socket path mismatch and destructor double-close

**Summary:** Two bugs found during live testing on the cluster.

### Changes

1. **`ase_ipi_server_mace.py`** — Changed socket path from `/tmp/ipi_<name>` to `/tmp/<name>` to match the C++ client's hardcoded default (`/tmp/ase_ipi_socket`). The `ipi_` prefix was a leftover from ASE's SocketIOCalculator convention which we no longer use.

2. **`src_clean/ase_energy_client.h`** — Removed `~Socket()` destructor. gRASPA copies `Socket` objects when `SystemComponents` vectors are resized during init, causing the destructor to close the shared `fd` on each temporary copy. This resulted in "Bad file descriptor" errors on subsequent socket calls. The OS handles fd cleanup on process exit; `close_socket()` remains available for explicit use.

3. **`patch_Socket/ase_energy_client.h`** — Regenerated from `src_clean/`.

## 2026-02-17 — Fix socket init/shutdown and startup sequencing

**Summary:** `connect_socket()` was defined but never called, causing gRASPA to
crash on the first socket write (`fd = -1`). Additionally, a startup deadlock
existed: the server waited for `socket_species.txt` before accepting connections,
but gRASPA couldn't write that file without a live socket. The shutdown path
also never called `close_socket()`.

### Changes

1. **`ase_ipi_server_mace.py`** — Extracted handshake from `serve()` into standalone `do_handshake()`. Restructured `main()` startup order to: bind+listen → accept → handshake → wait for species file → serve loop. This breaks the deadlock because the server now accepts the connection and completes the handshake before needing the species file.

2. **`socket-patch/Socket/PATCH_SOCKET_main.cpp.txt`** — Restructured the `PATCH_SOCKET_MAIN_PREP` init block. Now calls `WrapSuperCellAtomIntoUCBox()` + `GenerateReplicaCells(true)` to populate `ReplicaAtoms`, then `WriteSpeciesFile()`, then `connect_socket()`, then the first test `Predict()`. Previously `MCEnergyWrapper()` bundled all of this but required a connected socket.

3. **`src_clean/ase_energy_client.h`** — Added lazy-connect safety net in `PredictFromSocket()`: if `fd < 0`, auto-connects or exits fatally. Added `~Socket()` destructor that calls `close_socket()` for clean shutdown.

4. **`test_ipi_server.py`** — Updated all server thread functions to call `do_handshake()` then `serve()` separately. Added `do_handshake` to imports.

5. **`patch_Socket/`** — Regenerated from `src_clean/` + `socket-patch/`.

## 2026-02-17 — Cache framework and adsorbate energies in Predict()

**Summary:** `Predict()` previously made 3 socket round-trips per MC move
(E_total, E_framework, E_adsorbate). Since the framework is rigid and the
adsorbate molecule is replicated identically each time, E_framework and
E_adsorbate are constant. They are now computed once and cached, reducing
socket calls by ~67% after initialization.

### Changes

1. **`src_clean/ase_energy_client.h`** — Added cache fields (`cached_E_framework_ev`, `cached_E_adsorbate_ev`, `cache_valid`) to the `Socket` struct. Modified `Predict()` to compute and cache E_framework and E_adsorbate on the first call, then reuse cached values on all subsequent calls. Debug output labels each energy as `(computed)`, `(computed, cached)`, or `(cached)`.

2. **`patch_Socket/ase_energy_client.h`** — Regenerated from `src_clean/` via `patch.py` to include the caching changes.

3. **`test_ipi_server.py`** — Added `TestCachingBehaviour` test class with `test_cache_reduces_calls` that simulates 3 Predict() cycles: the first issues 3 socket evaluations (total + framework + adsorbate), the second and third issue only 1 each (total only), verifying cached values remain consistent.

4. **`iPI_SOCKET_DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`** — Updated Overview, Socket Struct, Key Methods, Energy Calculation Strategy, Runtime Workflow, and Known Limitations sections to document the caching optimization.
